        <p> Thanks for volunteering! You will be translating the following Antigone passage using a prototype digital reading environment. Read the following thoroughly before continuing to the next tab.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only use the digital reading environment in front of you for translation aid. Do not use your phone or open other tabs on this device.</li>
          <li>Do not reload the page, as that will reset the digital reading environment. If you encounter an issue, alert someone.</li>
          <li>Click on bolded text to see relevant commentary items in the pane to the right.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> When you're ready, you can move on to the next tab, but know you can review these guidelines at any time.</h3>
